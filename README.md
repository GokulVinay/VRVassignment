# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI**

### **Overview**
This project is an admin dashboard for managing users, roles, and permissions in a secure and user-friendly manner. It was built as part of the VRV Security Frontend Developer Intern Assignment to demonstrate my skills in frontend development, UI design, and role-based access control system implementation.

   - Assign roles to users and manage their status (Active/Inactive).

2. **Role Management**
   - Create, edit, and delete roles.
   - Assign specific permissions (Read, Write, Delete) to roles.

3. **Dynamic Permissions**
   - Easily assign or modify permissions for roles.
   - Display permissions clearly for better visibility and control.

4. **Custom API Simulation**
   - Mock API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.
   - Simulated server responses to validate functionality.
